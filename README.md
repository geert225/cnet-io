## what is this project?
 this project is all about the learning procces of how to build firmware for 32 bit micro controllers and trying to understand how industrial communication protocols work. For this board i have chosen a stm 32 F217VET6 micro controller and the following protocols: Profibus, Profinet and Fanuc i/o link. The end goal is that i have a board that is to be able to be controlled by a plc or a robot controller.
